- title: Product Hunt
  slug: producthunt
  description: Discover the latest tech products. It serves as a launchpad for startups and developers.
  icon: browser
  color: white
  intro: >-
    Product Hunt is a premier platform for discovering the latest tech products, where innovation meets visibility.
    It's the go-to place for tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and industry influencers to find and discuss cutting-edge tools, apps, and services.
     
    By launching on Product Hunt, startups and developers can gain invaluable exposure, attract early users, and receive feedback from a vibrant and engaged community.

  checklist:
  - point: Benefits of Launching on Product hunt
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      1. Get feedback
      If you want to validate your idea or want to know what features you can add, you can launch your MVP on Product Hunt and get feedback from users.

      2. Social proof
      Product Hunt badge is a great way to show that people love your product. You can add it to your landing page and build trust in your visitors.

      3. Drive traffic and Boost your sales
      Product Hunt has 4M visitors per month on average. So a product hunt launch will help you to put your product in front of these many people and drive traffic to your website.

      4. Grow your Email list
      If you want to grow the email list size of your newsletter, you can launch a free product on product hunt & get subscribers from it.

      5. Get featured in newsletters and directories for free
      A lot of curated newsletters and directories look for tools on Product Hunt to add to their libraries. So, you can get featured in the newsletter and directories for free by launching on Product Hunt.
      
      6. Backlink from a high DA site
      When you list your submission, Product Hunt will link to your product’s website which means you get a backlink from Product Hunt. And since Product Hunt has a domain rating of 91, this backlink can add authority to your site & help improve your SEO.

    link: https://producthunt.com/
  
  - point: What type of traffic can you expect?
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      We’ve found that products that make it to the bottom of the front page can expect over 2,000 unique visitors on launch day. Products that hit the #1 spot can gain over 10,000 uniques.
      While these numbers aren't exceptional, remember that conversion rates tend to be strong because Product Hunt's audience members are innovation fanatics.
      Ten thousand site visits could turn into 1,000-3,000 genuine leads for your business. We'll expand on this point in the conversion goal section right below.
      Plus, when you hit the top five products of the day, you're featured in the next day's Product Hunt digest email.

    link: https://producthunt.com/
  
  - point: The rules of pre-launch
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      1. Don’t focus on upvotes. Set a real conversion goal.
      Upvotes are mostly a vanity metric. Keep your eye on the ball. What you want are email addresses and leads.
      While upvotes can propel your product to the top of the front page, what really matters is what you do with the traffic.
      In short, most SaaS, service, and ecommerce startups should optimize their Product Hunt launch for capturing emails.


      2. Don’t launch before you have a small following
      The biggest Product Hunt mistake is launching before your pre-launch audience is primed. The top hunters told us this over and over. Not enough people are listening when they warn about this.
      To have a successful launch, you need at least a small group of supporters who are willing to advocate for your product. This is because Product Hunt doesn't create momentum. It amplifies momentum.
      PH is not the channel you use to get your first set of users. It's the second channel you use—once you have that small starting set.
      We suggest an audience of at least 400 people before launching.


      3. The quality of engagement matters most
      On Product Hunt, the quality of upvotes is more important than the quantity of upvotes.
      Quality upvotes come from active PH-ers. They've been on the platform for months and engage regularly.
      Product Hunt's algorithm appears to favor products that get engagement from established PH members.


      4. Get a Product Hunt insider to hunt your product
      “Hunting” is Product Hunt–speak for posting your product.
      In the past, it was important to have a reputable Product Hunt member hunt your product. That’s because Product Hunt used to send an email to that hunter's followers when they hunted. So the larger a hunter's follower base, the more awareness a product got.
      Product Hunt no longer sends those email notifications. Instead, they're on record suggesting that you hunt your own product. They say it’s easier, and you’ll save the time you’d spend convincing a popular hunter to post on your behalf.
      

      5. Time your emails
      Product Hunt launches are a game of timing.
      Blast all your channels at once—and do it first thing in the morning. You want to climb to the top of the daily rankings fast, then spread out the remainder of your votes evenly throughout the day to maintain your "vote velocity." This will keep your product ranked highly.
      Three to four weeks in advance, send an email to your list explaining the value Product Hunt will have for your launch. Help recipients understand how important it is to you. Ask them to create an account and engage with PH. Only a small percentage of the people on your list will. That's normal. But those who do will become invested in your launch and success.
      Schedule a follow-up email to trigger three days after your first. Ask recipients to spend two minutes upvoting and commenting on a few products on PH. While this is a big ask, it can have a significant impact on launch day. The Product Hunt algorithm favors votes from “warmed up” accounts.
      Prepare an email for launch day. Ask your list for feedback—not upvotes. If discovered by Product Hunt, requests for upvotes can result in a demotion of your product. Schedule the email to go out in batches throughout the day. To fight post decay and sustain velocity, you want to spread out your engagement over the course of the day.

  - point: Schedule the launch and create the teaser page
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      One of the best ways to start promoting your Product Hunt launch is by creating a teaser page.
      

      A Teaser page will help you:

      1. Build a following for your launch: Share the teaser page on social media platforms, communities, and your email list to build a following for your launch who get notified when you launch.
      2. Get feedback: Share the teaser page online and collect feedback from your target audience. This will help you improve your product before the launch.
      3. Attract more attention: By having a teaser page, you can feature your launch on the “coming soon” page of PH. This will help you gain more followers before the launch.

    link: https://producthunt.com/



  - point: Set a clear goal
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      There's nothing worse than putting a ton of time into your launch, only to not know whether the effort was worthwhile. 
      In order to avoid wasted time and effort, have a crystal clear goal of what you want to achieve. 
      This will inform your level of preparation, which channels to target, or even which day you want to launch.
      For instance, launching on the weekend will be the easiest path to finishing 1st (Product of the Day), 
      but you'll have fewer visitors and likely a different audience (i.e. more Indie Hackers vs. SaaS employees).

      - Finish as Product of the Day

      - Minimum of 800 Upvotes (which we realized was too low!)

      - 300 new signups, who would bring in other users by sharing Supademos

      - At least 10 paying customers directly from Product Hunt

      - Backlinks and coverage from Product Hunt and affiliated websites

    link: https://producthunt.com/

  - point: Hunt down your launch date and choose your hunter
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Once you have a clear goal, it’s time to establish your timelines. Narrow down to whether you want to launch on a weekday or weekend.


      Launch on weekends:

        - Your priority is to become a top 3 product of the day

        - If you already have a good community around your product

        - Are targeting indie hackers, consumers, or casual audiences

      
      Launch on weekdays:

        - You want to create a community around your product
        - You want to gain new paying customers
        - You want your product to be mentioned/amplified in the Product Hunt newsletter


      Next, you need to choose a Hunter
      While finding a well-known Hunter isn’t a requirement (in fact, you can both build and hunt your own product), 
      it’s generally accepted that a known Hunter will amplify your product distribution and success. 
      Why? Your Hunter will come with an existing pool of followers, helping you hit the ground running — and also serve as social proof during launch.

    link: https://producthunt.com/
  
  - point: Create a “Coming Soon” page
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Create a “Coming Soon” page on Product Hunt to funnel leads towards your upcoming launch. 
      Create an engaging “Coming Soon” page on Product Hunt with a teaser for your product. 
      This page helps generate organic buzz and drive visitors to a page with clear intent.
      

      For the next 14 days, link this “Coming Soon” page on your:

        - Email signatures
        - Websites header
        - Blog posts

    link: https://producthunt.com/

  - point: Identify and build your distribution
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      The next step is identifying your existing distribution channels to approximate how many upvotes you can expect from your existing audience.
      In 2023, most “Product of the Day” winners ended up with 1000+ upvotes, so that’s the minimum floor you should aim for if that is the ultimate goal.
      From there, you want to identify all of your existing audience channels, potential support sources, and the effort/work required for you to hit your benchmark for each source.
      After tallying up your estimates, you should have a clear tally of expected upvotes and the upvote gap you’ll need to fill.

      After tallying up your estimates, you should have a clear tally of expected upvotes as well as the upvote gap you'll need to fill.


      You can deploy strategies like:

      Posting thought leadership/value and plugging your launch link;

      Looking for similar products on PH and reaching out to the makers for support/feedback;

      Joining relevant Slack groups or communities and contributing;

      Scanning keywords or conversations on Twitter about similar products;

      Replying to relevant questions on Reddit, Quora, or IndieHackers with a link to your launch;

      Reaching out to folks that commented/upvoted to winning products, and asking for feedback;

      WhatsApp groups like ProductHunters

    link: https://producthunt.com/

  - point: Prep tactics for Launch Day
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      First, clear your calendar for launch day and the day after launch. A good launch will get you lots of exposure, support questions and feedback. 
      You’ll want to make sure you have the time to exploit your launch. Next, use your calendar to time block specific tactics you’ll deploy throughout the day. 
      For instance, block off time to send off email sequences, post on socials, reach out to your network on LinkedIn, etc.

      Assess Competition
      A few days before launch, get a pulse on your competition by looking at Product Hunt’s Coming Soon Page. 
      This way, you don’t get surprised by GPT5 launching on the same day.

      Draft up your Email Sequences and Messages
      Prepare your email sequences or blasts — whether you’re reaching out to existing users or other companies recently launched on Product Hunt. 
      Since Supademo works with companies across 50+ countries, we created three separate emails at different times and locations to align timing.

      Prepare Launch Assets
      Put on your creative hat and start designing all of the graphics, videos, and text you'll be adding to your launch page.

      Prepare Maker Comment
      A maker comment is a short blurb that you'll add to your Product Hunt post, 

      Quickly introduce yourself
      Describe why you're building your product
      What problems you solve for your users (along with potential use cases)
      And a CTA/prompt for folks to comment or leave feedback

    link: https://producthunt.com/
  
  - point: Launch and Grind
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Make sure you're well rested, properly caffeinated, and ready to grind for 24 hours. A successful launch requires both tactical preparation and relentless effort during launch day.

      To ensure you start off with a bang, make sure you start reaching out to customers and folks a few hours before 12:01am.

      Getting to the first three spots will create a level of organic momentum (e.g. lots of PH visitors don't scroll below the top three products) that will amplify your launch.

      Then throughout the day, follow through and execute on all of the tactical activities while DM'ing/reaching out to as many people as possible. Your goal is to obnoxiously shout from the rooftops and tell your story - no matter how cringe it can be.
