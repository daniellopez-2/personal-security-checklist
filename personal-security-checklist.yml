    The goal of Startup Directories is to inform people of what startups are out there, and to help people find what apps they could possibly need based on their filters or search terms. 
    Startup Directories usually have a lot of traffic passing through them, so these directories are some of the best places to start with digital marketing and branding. 
    To top it all off, they help a lot with widening your online presence.

  intro: >-
    Product Hunt is a premier platform for discovering the latest tech products, where innovation meets visibility.
    It's the go-to place for tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and industry influencers to find and discuss cutting-edge tools, apps, and services.
     
    By launching on Product Hunt, startups and developers can gain invaluable exposure, attract early users, and receive feedback from a vibrant and engaged community.

  checklist:
  - point: Establish a clear goal
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      There's nothing worse than putting a ton of time into your launch, only to not know whether the effort was worthwhile. 
      In order to avoid wasted time and effort, have a crystal clear goal of what you want to achieve. 
      This will inform your level of preparation, which channels to target, or even which day you want to launch.
      For instance, launching on the weekend will be the easiest path to finishing 1st (Product of the Day), 
      but you'll have fewer visitors and likely a different audience (i.e. more Indie Hackers vs. SaaS employees).

      - Finish as Product of the Day

      - Minimum of 800 Upvotes (which we realized was too low!)

      - 300 new signups, who would bring in other users by sharing Supademos

      - At least 10 paying customers directly from Product Hunt

      - Backlinks and coverage from Product Hunt and affiliated websites
